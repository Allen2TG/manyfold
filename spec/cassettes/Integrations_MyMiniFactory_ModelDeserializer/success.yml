        all was finished, it cannot be denied that this work has carried off the palm
        from all other statues, modern or ancient, Greek or Latin; no other artwork
        is equal to it in any respect, with such just proportion, beauty and excellence
        did Michelagnolo finish it\u201d.\u00a0-\u00a0Giorgio Vasari  Better than
        anyone else, Giorgio Vasari introduces in a few words the marvel of one of
        the greatest masterpieces ever created by mankind. At the Accademia Gallery,
        you can admire from a short distance the perfection of the most famous statue
        in Florence and, perhaps, in all the world: Michelangelo\u2019s David.  This
        astonishing Renaissance sculpture was created between 1501 and 1504. It is
        a 14.0 ft marble statue depicting the Biblical hero David, represented as
        a standing male nude. Originally commissioned by the Opera del Duomo for the
        Cathedral of Florence, it was meant to be one of a series of large statues
        to be positioned in the niches of the cathedral\u2019s tribunes, way up at
        about 80mt from the ground. Michelangelo was asked by the consuls of the Board
        to complete an unfinished project begun in 1464 by Agostino di Duccio and
        later carried on by Antonio Rossellino in 1475. Both sculptors had in the
        end rejected an enormous block of marble due to the presence of too many \u201ctaroli\u201d,
        or imperfections, which may have threatened the stability of such a huge statue.
        This block of marble of exceptional dimensions remained therefore neglected
        for 25 years, lying within the courtyard of the Opera del Duomo (Vestry Board).  \u00a0  Michelangelo
        was only 26 years old in 1501, but he was already the most famous and best
        paid artist in his days. He accepted the challenge with enthusiasm to sculpt
        a large scale David and worked constantly for over two years to create one
        of his most breathtaking masterpieces of gleaming white marble.  The Vestry
        Board had established the religious subject for the statue, but nobody expected
        such a revolutionary interpretation of the biblical hero.  The account of
        the battle between David and Goliath is told in Book 1 Samuel. Saul and the
        Israelites are facing the Philistines near the Valley of Elah. Twice a day
        for 40 days, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, comes out between the
        lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to
        decide the outcome in single combat. Only David, a young shepherd, accepts
        the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines
        since it is too large, taking only his sling and five stones from a brook.
        David and Goliath thus confront each other, Goliath with his armor and shield,
        David armed only with his rock, his sling, his faith in God and his courage.
        David hurls a stone from his sling with all his might and hits Goliath in
        the center of his forehead: Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David
        then cuts off his head.  Traditionally, David had been portrayed after his
        victory, triumphant over the slain Goliath. Florentine artists like Verrocchio,
        Ghiberti and Donatello all depicted their own version of David standing over
        Goliath\u2019s severed head. Michelangelo instead, for the first time ever,
        chooses to depict David before the battle. David is tense: Michelangelo catches
        him at the apex of his concentration. He stands relaxed, but alert, resting
        on a classical pose known as contrapposto. The figure stands with one leg
        holding its full weight and the other leg forward, causing the figure\u2019s
        hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to
        the entire torso.  The slingshot he carries over his shoulder is almost invisible,
        emphasizing that David\u2019s victory was one of cleverness, not sheer force.
        He transmits exceptional self-confidence and concentration, both values of
        the \u201cthinking man\u201d, considered perfection during the Renaissance.  It
        is known from archive documents that Michelangelo worked at the statue in
        utmost secrecy, hiding his masterpiece in the making up until January 1504.
        Since he worked in the open courtyard, when it rained he worked soaked. Maybe
        from this he got his inspiration for his method of work: it is said he created
        a wax model of his design, and submerged it in water. As he worked, he would
        let the level of the water drop, and using different chisels, sculpted what
        he could see emerging. He slept sporadically, and when he did he slept with
        his clothes and even in his boots still on, and rarely ate, as his biographer
        Ascanio Condivi reports.  After more than two years of tough work, Michelangelo
        decided to present his \u201cGiant\u201d to the members of the Vestry Board
        and to Pier Soderini, the then gonfaloniere of the Republic. In January 1504,
        his 14 foot tall David was unveiled only to them: they all agreed that it
        was far too perfect to be placed up high in the Cathedral, thus it was decided
        to discuss another location in town. The city council convened a committee
        of about thirty members, including artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro
        Botticelli and Giuliano da Sangallo, to decide on an appropriate site for
        David. During the long debate, nine different locations for the statue were
        discussed, and eventually the statue was placed in the political heart of
        Florence, in Piazza della Signoria.  It took four days and forty men to move
        the statue the half mile from Michelangelo\u2019s workshop behind Santa Maria
        del Fiore Cathedral to the Piazza della Signoria. Luca Landucci, herbalist
        and diarist living nearby, wrote down the exceptional event of the transport
        in his chronicles:  \u201cIt was midnight, May 14th, and the Giant was taken
        out of the workshop. They even had to tear down the archway, so huge he was.
        Forty men were pushing the large wooden cart where David stood protected by
        ropes, sliding it through town on trunks. The Giant eventually got to Signoria
        Square on June 8th 1504, where it was installed next to the entrance to the
        Palazzo Vecchio, replacing Donatello\u2019s bronze sculpture of Judith and
        Holofernes\u201d.  Michelangelo then kept on working on the finer finishing.
        That summer, the sling and tree-stump support were gilded, and the figure
        was given a gilded victory-garland. Unfortunately, all gilded surfaces have
        been lost due to the long period of exposure to weathering agents.  Thanks
        to its imposing perfection, the biblical figure of David became the symbol
        the liberty and freedom of the Republican ideals, showing Florence\u2019s
        readiness to defend itself. It remained in front of Palazzo della Signoria
        until 1873, when it was moved into the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia to protect
        it from damage and further weathering.  Nowadays, visitors can admire the
        David under a skylight which was designed just for him in the 19th century
        by Emilio de Fabris. From a close distance, one can perceive Micheangelo\u2019s
        passion for the human anatomy and his deep knowledge of the male body.  Note
        the watchful eyes with carved eye bulks, pulsing veins on the back of the
        hands, engorged with tension. Admire the curve of the taut torso, the flexing
        of the thigh muscles in the right leg.  The proportions of some details are
        atypical of Michelangelo\u2019s work. The figure has an unusually large head
        and imposing right hand.These enlargements may be due to the fact that the
        statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roof line, so
        important parts of the sculpture had to be necessarily accentuated in order
        to be visible from below.  Another interpretation about these larger details
        lead scholars to think that Michelangelo intentionally over-proportioned the
        head to underline the concentration and the right hand to symbolize the pondered
        action.  Once again, Giorgio Vasari was able to synthesize the absolute perfection
        of this Renaissance masterpiece which still attracts, and does not disappoint,
        millions of visitors every year at the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia in Florence:  \u201cFor
        in it may be seen most beautiful contours of legs, with attachments of limbs
        and slender outlines of flanks that are divine; nor has there ever been seen
        a pose so easy, or any grace to equal that in this work, or feet, hands and
        head so well in accord, one member with another, in harmony, design, and excellence
        of artistry\u201d.\u2028 (Giorgio Vasari, from his \u201cLives of the most
